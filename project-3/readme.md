<h1>Project 3 Readme</h1>
<p>I am going to do an article on my sister Elsa Godwin who recently committed to the Griz for volleyball. My sister goes to Sentinel high school so naturally some of the colors in my color pallette will be purple and yellow. And now she is committed to the Griz so some other colors will be maroon and grey.</p>
<p>I got the article from the Missoulian.<a href="http://missoulian.com/sports/high-school/volleyball/sentinel-s-elsa-godwin-commits-to-griz-volleyball-team/article_1e3835db-1218-559a-a3d7-1c890f9ad9f9.html"><cite>Sentinel's Elsa Godwin</cite> by Kyle Houghtaling, April 4, 2017</p>
