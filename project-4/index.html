  <p><b>YES!! It is very important.</b> Responsive Web Design makes your webpage look the same on all platforms. Whether it is a phone, laptop, desktop, or tablet, it will all look and flow the same.</p>
  <p>RWD is the combination of flexible grids, images, and media queries. It helps the user become more efficient on your webpage by being able to view it in the same way from any device.</p>
  <h2>Some things we do with it:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Viewport: sets the visible area of a web page</li>
    <li>Media Query: limit the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color</li>
    <li>Flex Box: creates boxes that rearrange themselves on a page as its dimensions change.</li>
