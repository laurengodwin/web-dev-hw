      <h1>Dirt On My Boots</h1>
      <h2>By Jon Pardi</h2>
      <p>Might have a little dirt on my boots<br>
        But I'm taking you uptown tonight<br>
        Might have a little mud on my wheels<br>
        But they're gonna shine with you're up inside<br>
        Gonna hit the club, gonna cut a rug<br>
        Burn it up like neon lights<br>
        Might have a little dirt on my boots<br>
        But we're gonna dance the dust right off them tonight (yeah, girl)<br>
        Got a little dirt on my boots</p>
