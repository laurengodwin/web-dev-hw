    <p>Elsa Godwin, the girl who was on the Sentinel volleyball varsity team by the end of her freshman season. Godwin has been a star along with the rest of her team. Sentinel Spartans were able to win back-to-back State Championships's 2016-2017.<br>
      Godwin has lead her team with an undefeated season 2 years in a row. The Spartan's are the team to beat next year but Godwin won't be there to lead that team, instead she'll have a new role as the outside hitter for the Griz Volleyball team.<br>
      Redshirting her first year Godwin is hoping to increase her vertical. Currently she has a 9' vertical and with the proper training she should be able to reach over 10'. Godwin has left a great legacy at Sentinel but I am sure she'll continue that legacy throughout college.</p>
