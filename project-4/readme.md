<h1>Project 4: The Responsive Page</h1>
<p>This was a fun assignment. I did my page on whether or not RWD was important.<br>
In my responsive page I included 3 additional links to sites that give more information on RWD.<br>
Then I included a cute image of what RWD looks like on different platforms.<br>
At the bottom of my page I said that RWD is important and the meaning of what it is.</p>
